This mini project is a simple technical implementation of a Plants-vs-Zombies–style game, focusing on core game logic rather than polished graphics or full gameplay. The project demonstrates how basic game systems can be built from scratch, including:

* **Grid-based board logic:** The game world is represented as a 2D grid where each cell can hold plants or allow zombies to move.
* **Object-oriented design:** Plants and zombies are implemented as separate classes with their own properties (health, damage, behavior patterns) and methods that define how they interact.
* **Game loop implementation:** A continuous update loop processes movement, collisions, attacks, and state changes at each step of the game.
* **Resource and state management:** Variables track plant placement, zombie waves, hit points, and win/lose conditions.
* **Simple rendering:** The UI is basic and intended to visualize game states rather than provide full graphics.
* **Event handling:** Player actions—such as placing plants—trigger updates in the game state through simple input-handling logic.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of game architecture fundamentals, class structure, object interactions, and step-by-step state updates in a controlled mini-game environment.
